## Getting Started

*  Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
*  Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all    of your HTML.
*  Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
*  Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
*  Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images
*  In your css folder, create a style.css file.
*  In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and       jQuery.
*  In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.

## Game Function
*  You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).
*  The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 
*  The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players      answer correctly and incorrectly.
*  Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.
*  Don't forget to include a countdown timer.
